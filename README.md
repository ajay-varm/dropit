# A Cool idea and i tried to turn it down to happen.

Its an idea that comes in mind when me and my friend are talking and i tried to make it happen but due to other issues i stopped because of some reasons.
The repository will help someone who is looking codes for :
 1.logins and signups with firebase
 2.camera feature
 3.tabs changing and some small amazing ui stuff.
 
 happy coding :)
